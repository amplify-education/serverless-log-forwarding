# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed before starting:
* [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
* [serverless](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/installation/)

## Installing

To install the plugin, run:

```shell
npm install serverless-log-forwarding
```

Then make the following edits to your `serverless.yaml` file:

```yaml
plugins:
  - serverless-log-forwarding

custom:
  logForwarding:
    destinationARN: '[ARN of Lambda Function to forward logs to]'
    # optional:
    roleArn: '[ARN of the IAM role that grants Cloudwatch Logs permissions]'
    filterPattern: '[filter pattern for logs that are sent to Lambda function]'
    normalizedFilterID: true # whether to use normalized function name as filter ID
    stages:
      - '[name of the stage to apply log forwarding]'
      - '[another stage name to filter]'
    createLambdaPermission: true # whether to create the AWS::Lambda::Permission for the destinationARN (when policy size limits are a concern)

functions:
  myFunction:
    handler: src/someHandler
    # optional properties for per-function configuration:
    logForwarding:
      # set enabled to false to disable log forwarding for a single given function
      enabled: false

```

## Running Tests
To run unit tests:
```
npm run test
```

For running integration tests you will need to log into you AWS account 
and set AWS_PROFILE environment variable, 
it will be used to create AWS entities for testing purposes
```
export AWS_PROFILE=<profile_name>
export SERVERLESS_LICENSE_KEY=<sls_license_key>
npx npm run build
npx npm run integration-test
```

All tests should pass. All unit tests should pass before merging.
Integration tests will probably take some time

If there is an error update the node_modules inside the root folder of the directory:
```
npm install
```

## Writing Integration Tests
Unit tests are found in `test/unit-tests`. 
Integration tests are found in `test/integration-tests`. 

`test/integration-tests` contains configs folder, 
for every test there is a folder with `serverless.yml` configuration and `logs_producer.py`.

To add another test create a folder for your test with the folder name that corresponds to test name
and add code to run test to `test/integration-tests/integration-tests.ts`


## Deploying

---------
The plugin will be packaged with the lambda when deployed as normal using Serverless:

```shell
serverless deploy
```
