```

Then make the following edits to your `serverless.yaml` file:

```yaml
plugins:
  - serverless-log-forwarding

custom:
  logForwarding:
    destinationARN: '[ARN of Lambda Function to forward logs to]'
    # optional:
    roleArn: '[ARN of the IAM role that grants Cloudwatch Logs permissions]'
    filterPattern: '[filter pattern for logs that are sent to Lambda function]'
    normalizedFilterID: true # whether to use normalized function name as filter ID
    stages:
      - '[name of the stage to apply log forwarding]'
      - '[another stage name to filter]'
    createLambdaPermission: true # whether to create the AWS::Lambda::Permission for the destinationARN (when policy size limits are a concern)

functions:
  myFunction:
    handler: src/someHandler
    # optional properties for per-function configuration:
    logForwarding:
      # set enabled to false to disable log forwarding for a single given function
      enabled: false

```
